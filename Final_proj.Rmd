In this Project, We are asked to predict the chances of a user listening to a song repetitively after the first observable listening event within a time window was triggered. If there are recurring listening event(s) triggered within a month after the userâ€™s very first observable listening event, its target is marked 1, and 0 otherwise in the training set. The same rule applies to the testing set.

KKBOX provides a training data set consists of information of the first observable listening event for each unique user-song pair within a specific time duration. Metadata of each unique user and song pair is also provided. The use of public data to increase the level of accuracy of your prediction is encouraged.

The train and the test data are selected from users listening history in a given time period. Note that this time period is chosen to be before the WSDM-KKBox Churn Prediction time period. The train and test sets are split based on time, and the split of public/private are based on unique user/song pairs.

Target = 1 refers to a listener who listened to a song within a month of the first observed listening event 
Target = 0 refers to a listener who does not listen to the song again within a month of first hearing it

Our Final target is to build the csv file with Row_Id for the songs and its target value.

Having almost five different tables to load data:
1) Members
2) Songs
3) Extra information on songs
4) Train set
5) Test set

Step I : Data Cleansing and Operations

The procedure below is for data gathering and merging as per requirement

```{r,echo = TRUE}
#Loading Members Table
members <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swigodsky/Music-Recommender-System/master/members.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
members <- members[1:10000,]
colnames(members) <- c("user_id", "city", "age", "gender", "registration_method", "registration_time", "expiration_date")
members$age <- gsub(0, NA, members$age) #replace age that is recorded as zero with NA
```


# Operations on Extra information on songs

```{r,echo = TRUE,fileEncoding="latin1"}
song_extra_info <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swigodsky/Music-Recommender-System/master/song_extra_infob.csv",header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
song_extra_info <- song_extra_info[1:4000,]
head(song_extra_info)
```


# Operations on loading songs data

```{r,echo = TRUE}
songs <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swigodsky/Music-Recommender-System/master/songsd.csv", header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(songs) = as.character(unlist(songs[1,]))
songs <- songs[-1,]
songs<-songs[1:10000,]
colnames(songs) <- c("song_id", "song_length", "genre_id", "artist_name", "composer", "lyricist", "language")
head(songs)
```

## Test and train data

```{r,echo = TRUE}
#Loading Test Data - This Is Used For Submission To Kaggle
testdata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swigodsky/Music-Recommender-System/master/test.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
testdata <-testdata[1:4000,]
colnames(testdata) <- c("row_id", "user_id", "song_id", "system_tab", "layout_seen", "entry_source")
```


#Loading Training Data - This is Used To Build and Test The Prediction Model

```{r,echo = TRUE}
trainingdata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swigodsky/Music-Recommender-System/master/trainb.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

testwithtargetknown <-trainingdata[6001:8000,] #this data frame will be used to test our model
colnames(testwithtargetknown) <- c("user_id", "song_id", "system_tab", "layout_seen", "entry_source", "target")

trainingdata <-trainingdata[1:6000,]
colnames(trainingdata) <- c("user_id", "song_id", "system_tab", "layout_seen", "entry_source", "target")
head(trainingdata)
```

#### First graph to get our predictions right

```{r,echo = TRUE}
ggplot(trainingdata,aes(x= system_tab))+ theme_bw(base_size = 16) + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1)) + geom_bar(colour = "red")
```

It is clear that people will prefer to listen songs from their own library and have more probability to listen those songs again.


### Step II : Merging Operations for model building

```{r,echo = TRUE}
merger1 <- merge(trainingdata,songs,"song_id", all.x = TRUE)  
merger_train <- merge(merger1,members,"user_id", all.x = TRUE)

merger2 <- merge(testwithtargetknown,songs, by = "song_id", all.x=TRUE)  
merger_train2 <- merge(merger2,members, by = "user_id", all.x=TRUE)
```

```{r,echo = TRUE}
knitr::kable(head(merger_train))
```

```{r,echo = TRUE}
merger3 <- merge.data.frame(testdata,songs,by = "song_id", all.x = TRUE)
merger_test <- merge.data.frame(merger3,members,by = "user_id", all.x = TRUE)
```


#### The following chunk is written to get top 10  songs Id listened by users with descending orders.

```{r,echo = TRUE}
user_based <- data.frame(table(merger_train2$user_id))
song_based <- data.frame(table(merger2$song_id)) 
colnames(user_based) <- c("user_id","Frequency")
colnames(song_based) <- c("song_id","Frequency1")

user_based <- arrange(user_based,desc(Frequency))
user_based <- as.data.frame(user_based)
user_based$user_id <- as.character(user_based$user_id)


song_based <- arrange(song_based,desc(Frequency1))
song_based <- as.data.frame(song_based)

top_n(song_based,10,Frequency1)
```


### Step III : Developement of model

Considering The Proportion of Users Who Listen to a Song More Than Once Within One Month of First Hearing It - Target = 1

```{r,echo = TRUE}
prop.table(table(merger_train$target))
merger_test$target <- rep(1,4000)
merger_train2$targetguess <- rep(1, 2000)
```

Inetresting!!! 78.73% of listeners listened to songs within a month of first hearing it. This means we can assume that most listeners will have a target of 1.


# Gender - target model

The graph gives a general idea of what gender group is more hearing music as per our data set.

```{r,echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data=subset(merger_train, !is.na(gender)), aes(x=gender)) + geom_bar(stat="count")
```

```{r,echo = TRUE}
prop.table(table(merger_train$gender, merger_train$target),1)
```

##### system Tab - target model

```{r,echo = TRUE}
prop.table(table(merger_train$system_tab, merger_train$target),1)
```

The system tab is the name of the tab where the event was triggered. System tabs are used to categorize KKBOX mobile apps functions. The target is zero for 75.80% of people whose system tab is radio and 63.04% of the people whose system tab is listen with. System tab will be helpful for making predictions.

#### Age- Target model

```{r,echo = TRUE}
merger_train$younger <- 0
merger_train$younger[merger_train$age < 30] <-1
prop.table(table(merger_train$younger, merger_train$target),1)
```

Different age cutoffs were tested, and at every age, the percentage of people who repeatedly listened to a song was approximately the same. 74% of people below and 79% of people above 30 years old listened to a song again within one month of first hearing it.


Taking into account every parameter we decided two develope two models for our final predictions


#### 1) Gender and System Tab - Target Model

There are a number of helpful predictions that can be produced based on this data. 31.57% of females and 20% of males with a system tab of radio had a target of 1. 37.50% of females and 0% of males with a system tab of 'listen with' had a target of 1, but 71% of people whose gender was not listed had a target of 1 with that system tab. 90% of females and 17% of males with the search system tab had a target of 1.

```{r,echo = TRUE}
aggregate(target ~ system_tab + gender, data=merger_train, FUN=function(x) {sum(x)/length(x)})
```


Adjusting the Prediction to take into account listen with and female, male and search

```{r,echo = TRUE}
merger_test$target[is.na(merger_test$gender) & merger_test$system_tab=='listen with'] <- 1
merger_test$target[merger_test$gender=='male'& merger_test$system_tab=='search'] <- 0

merger_train2$targetguess[is.na(merger_train2$gender) & merger_train2$system_tab=='listen with'] <- 1
merger_train2$targetguess[merger_train2$gender=='male'& merger_train2$system_tab=='search'] <- 0
```


Comparing the Target to Our Guess of the Target


```{r,echo = TRUE}
(sum(merger_train2$target == merger_train2$targetguess))/2000
```

The target is correctly predicted 79.90% of the time.

#### Descision Tree

```{r,echo = TRUE}
fit <- rpart(target ~  gender + system_tab + entry_source, data=merger_train2, method="class")
#fancyRpartPlot(fit)
```


Using the Decision Tree to Predict the Target Value

```{r,echo = TRUE}
Prediction <- predict(fit, merger_train2, type = "class")
merger_train2$predict <- Prediction
(sum(merger_train2$target == merger_train2$predict))/2000
```
Using the decision tree, the target was predicted 80.30% of the time.

```{r,echo = TRUE}
submit <- data.frame(user_id = merger_test$user_id, target = merger_test$target)
write.csv(submit, file = "music.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```



### 2) Recommender Lab model

####Second model to get the desired sample_submisson file for our development of shiny app is made with 'Recommender lab' model 

As working with song_id was a tedious process,We gave sequential numbers "Row_id" to our train set for better understanding.
[Song_id's are bit lengthy here]

### Data processing

```{r,echo = TRUE}
merger_train$Row_id <- seq.int(nrow(merger_train))
fil <- dcast(merger_train, Row_id ~ target,value.var = "Row_id")
R <- as.matrix(fil)
r <- as(R,"realRatingMatrix") # R is converted into realRatingMatrix structure
```

```{r,echo = TRUE}
r_m <- normalize(r)
str(r_m)
head(as(r_m,"list"))
```

Heatmap for raw-targets and Normalized targets 

```{r,echo = TRUE}
image(r,main = "Raw Targets")
image(r_m,main = "Normalized Targets")
```

Turning matrix into binary model

```{r,echo = TRUE}
r_b <- binarize(r,minRating = 1)
head(as(r_b,"matrix"))
```

We used "UBCF" (User-based collaborative filtering) for the predictions.

```{r,echo = TRUE}
rec <- Recommender(r[1:nrow(r)],method="UBCF", param=list(normalize = "Z-score",method="Cosine",nn=25))
recom <- predict(rec,r[1:nrow(r)],type = "topNList",n = 10)
Row_id <- testdata$row_id 
rec_list <- as(recom,"list")
submission_file <- data.frame(matrix(unlist(rec_list[1:4000])))
colnames(submission_file) <- "Recommended_target"
submission_file1 <- as.data.frame(cbind(Row_id,submission_file))
head(submission_file1)
write.table(submission_file1,file = "submission.csv",row.names=FALSE,col.names=TRUE,sep=',')
```

Final submission file gives very clear picture of row_ids and their required targets,which was the official requirement of project!!


#### Step 4: Further development to help users with our results

In our attempt to build application through shiny and help users with our result ,a small attemp is made to develope the application .
